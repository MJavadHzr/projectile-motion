### Objective
The objective of this project is to simulate the motion of a projectile with air resistance which follows below equation

that *A* is the efficient surface of object, *p* is the air density, *v* is the velocity of object and *C_w* is a coefficient that is called drag coefficient.

-----------------------------------
### About Drag Coefficient
This coefficient has relation to Mach number which is the ratio of object velocity to air velocity and a typical graph of this relation has shown in figure 1.

I used [this digitizer](http://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/index.php) to get data from this figure (really really thanks them for their app 🙏)

### How to use? 🤨
As easy as possible :)

1. Clone project 😀
2. IF you don't have matplotlib installed, install it with this [guide](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
3. Run command-line module with your python interpreter (python 3.8.x is preferred)
4. Enter parameter (be carefull for units)
5. Watch graphs of motion and enjoy 😃

*Notice : you can find graph's file in *output* directory*


*P.S. : when a newbie code pyhton, don't care about project structure 😄*
